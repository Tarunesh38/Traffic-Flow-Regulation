#Traffic Signal Optimization using Image and Video Analysis

Traffic congestion is a pervasive issue in urban areas, leading to increased travel time, fuel consumption, and environmental pollution. Traditional traffic signal systems lack adaptability and struggle to efficiently handle varying traffic conditions. 

The problem is to design a system that optimizes traffic signal timings based on real-time traffic data, enhancing traffic flow and reducing congestion. In this context, leveraging advanced image analysis techniques becomes crucial for developing a smart and responsive traffic signal control mechanism.
